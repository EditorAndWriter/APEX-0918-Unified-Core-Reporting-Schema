# APEX-0918-Unified-Core-Reporting-Schema
### Disclaimer:  
The introductory clause is strictly informative. 

## Introduction 
This advertising impression reporting schema specification is intended to facilitate the acceptance, recognition and accreditation of the unique media currency provided by airline publishers of streaming entertainment. It may also have applicability to other advertising workflows within the transportation sector.
The normative clauses of this document define a concise and slightly constrained subset of the VAST 4.0 and VMAP 1.0.1 elements and attributes. This subset is classified based on functionality that is core to the onboard experience. Every enumerated element and attribute shall be allowed in IFE servers, clients and back-end reporting systems. It is anticipated that commercial schema validiation practices will emerge from specific use cases that take advantage of the clasifications established within this concensus document.  

Please refer to the Appendix for further background information and for insights into the context of this unification effort.
